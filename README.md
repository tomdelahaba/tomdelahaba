<b>Hello! My name's Tomas</b> 👋

I am an experienced *E-commerce consultant* (business / product owner) passionate about development and processes. I have huge experience in FMCG e-commerce segment and marketing. I started as a ```Java / C#``` developer few years ago and after that moved into business area. Now, I really started missing development and that is why I decided to return to development. I am starting with ```ReactJS - Javascript / Typescript``` and I would like to add React Native to my stack in future. I would like to refresh my ```Android / Kotlin``` knowledge and I would love to get deeper into ```Python```, mostly because of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

I love algorithms, optimalization, simplifying things. I currently live in Prague, I love motorcycles 🏍️, cars 🚗 and gardening 🌱.
